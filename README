README
put an api.py file in the root directory of crewai project.
Structure of your folder - 
D:\root_directory
│
├── pyproject.toml
├── api.py
└── src\
    └── query\
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── crew.py
        └── other_files.py
I have included the api.py file in this github repository.
Then, cd to the root directory and run this line on the terminal-
"uvicorn api:app --reload"

This ensures Python resolves imports starting from your project root.
You will get an https local link as http://127.0.0.1:8000/

To get a Swagger UI:
